Survey Notes:

Major
- Mostly CS
- Some other STEM

Year
- Freshmen, 1 senior
	- Great to be interested in research early

Interests
- Solving ODEs/PDEs
	- Yay
- Monte Carlo simulations
	- Can incorporate this
- I'm not entirely sure which path I want to go after college but I want to code this stuff because I think it's cool, so I think it would be awesome if I could see some of the applications of computation modeling this semester.
	- Gold star for you
- ML
	- Can incorporate some branches of ML, but not my specialty
- Computational neuroscience, prosthetics, neuroengineering
	- Sick, will get back to you

Skills
- Strengths: math foundations, high-level programming
- Develop: more specialized math, engineering, command line

Activities
- Good: discussions, lectures, demos
- Less popular: mentee presentations, reading

Takeaways
- Projects, beef up portfolio
- Both exposure to research in general, exposure to computational modeling
- Develop coding, math
