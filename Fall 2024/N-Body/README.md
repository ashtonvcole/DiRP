# 2-Body and N-Body Simulations

## A Note on Documentation

*Good documentation is just as important as good coding itself. You want your programs to be easy for other users (and your future self!) to use. Since this is a relatively simple, GitHub-based project, we will rely on the rendered README file. For this case, we will practice writing a good overview, project structure, and instructions for use.*
