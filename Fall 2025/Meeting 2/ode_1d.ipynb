    "Stability refers to whethter a particular methoud causes the approximate solution to blow up to unrealistically large values. Often a certain range for cobinations of the problem parameters and simulation discretizations has to be satisfied. In fluid mechanics, a common one is the Courant number, which describes how many cells a signal travels across in one time step. In general, and somewhat intuitively, it should be less than 1, but the basis for such rules is in mathematics."
